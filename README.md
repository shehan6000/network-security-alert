# Network Security Threat Detection and Recommendation System

This project is a comprehensive network security system designed to identify and alert potential cyber threats or network intrusions using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). The system generates a synthetic dataset similar to CICIDS2017, trains a Random Forest model to classify network traffic, and utilizes GPT-2 to provide recommendations for mitigating detected threats.


## Project Overview

The Network Security Threat Detection and Recommendation System aims to enhance network security by automating the detection of potential threats and providing actionable recommendations. The key components of the project include:

1. **Data Generation:** 
   - A synthetic dataset similar to the CICIDS2017 dataset is generated to simulate network traffic, including both benign and malicious activities.

2. **Model Training:**
   - A Random Forest classifier is trained on the synthetic dataset to distinguish between benign and malicious network traffic.

3. **Threat Detection and Alerting:**
   - The trained model is used to predict potential threats in new network traffic data. When a threat is detected, an alert is generated.

4. **Recommendation System:**
   - Using GPT-2, the system generates recommendations to mitigate the detected threats, providing actionable insights to network administrators.
